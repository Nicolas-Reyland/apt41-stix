            "description": "Adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to \nperform actions and bypass access controls. Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a \nrunning process. A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the \nchild of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process. When \nthis occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.\n\nAn adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing processes; this is known as \ntoken stealing. These token can then be applied to an existing process (i.e. Token Impersonation/Theft) or used to \nspawn a new process (i.e. Create Process with Token). An adversary must already be in a privileged user context (i.e. \nadministrator) to steal a token. However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context \nfrom the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. An adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote \nsystem as the account for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.\n\nAny standard user can use the runas command, and the Windows API functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does \nnot require access to an administrator account. There are also other mechanisms, such as Active Directory fields, \nthat can be used to modify access tokens.",
